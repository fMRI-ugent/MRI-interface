# fMRI-interface-Psychopy- by Stefania Mattioni-2024

This is a short Python script that syncs the Siemens Trio 3T MT scanner at the GIfMI (UZ Gent) with your experiment.  

## Short introduction
In fMRI experiments you need to configure your experiment to await the detection of triggers emitted by the scanner before progressing to present trials.
Typically, scanners use one of three methods to send triggers to your experiment:
1. Emulation of a keypress.
2. Through a parallel port.
3. Via a serial port.

## Included: 

- Folder/scannertrigger (@Created by Pieter Vandemaele-GIfMI): A PsychoPy function has been written by the GIfMI Software Engineer Pieter Vandemaele. 
It is designed to work with various trigger-sending methods. You can find this function, along with its respective readme file in the folder 'scannertrigger'.

- Minimal_Example_Script (@Created by Jonas Simoens): a brief example of a script outlining the step-by-step procedure to establish a connection with the fMRI scanner, wait for the scanner trigger (using the function ‘scennertrigger’ mentioned above), present visual stimulation, record the subject's response, and conclude the experiment.
In this example the emulation of a keypress is used as a method to detect the trigger from the scanner.
